<p>When designing a kitchen the question always comes up about how big the aisle needs to be between counters and base cabinets. Remember that the standard kitchen island height is 36 inches, with the average size measuring 3 by 6 1/2 feet. This distance ensures you can walk around the island easily. If your kitchen is less than 13 feet wide, we don�t recommend adding an island at all.</p>
