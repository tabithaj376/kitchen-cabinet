Solved! The Best Kitchen Island Size in 2020 Kitchen From pinterest.com
Double islands only work well in kitchens that have the room—if the kitchen is too small, two islands (even small ones) can cramp the space. This can, of course, become larger or smaller based on the space you’re working with. All islands vary in size and shape, but the minimum size that we recommend for a kitchen island is 1000mm x 1000mm. The best size for your kitchen island really depends on the size of your kitchen as a whole and whether you want to incorporate dining or breakfast bar ideas.
