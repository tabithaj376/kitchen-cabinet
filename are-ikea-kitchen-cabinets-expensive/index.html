IKEA Kitchen Review Remodel Cost, Quality Kitchn From thekitchn.com
Ikea kitchen cabinets for a full 10’ x 10’ kitchen range from about $1,100 to about $3,500. But, this post isn’t a love letter to ikea…i’ll save that for another time. Yes, you can save some money on custom cabinets by using local builders or smaller companies, but it is still far more expensive than ikea kitchen cabinets. We looked into ikea cabinets but it absolutely didn’t make sense financially for us as we live in a pretty expensive area (baltimore/washington suburbs).
