<p>More than 48 inches is overkill. A standard space to keep between countertop and kitchen upper cabinets is 18 inches. As much as possible you want to avoid needing to place your stove in the corner. Kitchen Design Dark Cherry and Black Stainless.</p>

How much space do you need for kitchen appliances? While granite counters typically overhang the front edges of cabinet boxes by 1.5, at the opening for the range the stone should be flush to the sides of the cabinets. Balance the size of appliances to other aspects of your kitchen, like kitchen cabinet space, countertop depth, and workspace.</p>
<h3 id="counters-designers-recommend-that-a-kitchen-include-at-least-158-total-inches-of-usable-countertop-which-is-considered-any-span-including-islands-that-is-at-least-24-inches-deep-and-has-at-least-15-inches-of-clearance-above">Counters Designers Recommend That A Kitchen Include At Least 158 Total Inches Of Usable Countertop, Which Is Considered Any Span, Including Islands, That Is At Least 24 Inches Deep And Has At Least 15 Inches Of Clearance Above.</h3><p>Also, leave at least 21 inches between the dishwasher and any adjacent appliances, cabinets, or other obstacles. This ensures that you can walk around the island easily and at the same time allows for at least two persons to use the space comfortably at the same time (one person can still walk behind another person standing in the front of the island). As much as possible you want to avoid needing to place your stove in the corner. You need to have a distance of at least one meter or 40 inches between the main kitchen work counter / cabinets and the kitchen island.</p>
<h3 id="but-it-can-be-anywhere-between-15-to-24-inches">But It Can Be Anywhere Between 15 To 24 Inches.</h3><p>A nominal ventilation gap is also needed at the front of the safety barrier and a 150mm minimum ventilation/access gap between the rear of the safety barrier (where installed) and back cabinetry. A clever solution is to turn dead space into deco space, by lining up bottles or say cookbooks in a row by height. The installation manual for your range probably specifies what size gap to use. A comfortable width is 48″ between cabinets and appliances.</p>
<h3 id="wolf-recommends-36-14-for-a-36-range">Wolf Recommends 36 1/4 For A 36 Range.</h3><p>There must also be a 100mm minimum clearance between the underside of the benchtop and the in bench cooktop safety barrier for gas connections. More than 48 inches is overkill. How do you fill the space between cabinets and ovens? How much space should be provided in front of a kitchen stove?</p>
