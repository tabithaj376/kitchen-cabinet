<p>You see, we didn�t actually go for a b&amp;q kitchen in the end. German kitchens are designed to sneak storage space into areas you may never even have thought of, giving us the flexibility to put together a kitchen that offers way more than the sum of its parts. Units all come pre assembled &amp; our cost less than b &amp; q. We once lived in a house with an older b&amp;q kitchen where the decorative film came off the bridging unit above the hob.</p>

<p>Howdens is the uk�s number one trade kitchen supplier providing thousands of products across kitchens, joinery, and hardware. Our kitchen fitter recommended howdens for quality. We almost bought a howdens kitchen, but realised that you only buy the planning and units. Kitchens that are much better value than Howdens, Wickes.</p>

<p>Ideally i would see a range of assembled howdens units to get a sense for their stability. Looking to get our kitchen done, budget of £20k absolute max. We installed a b&amp;q cooke and lewis high gloss cream kitchen in our old house and really loved it, id probably go with the same again in this house when the time comes.

<p>It’s seems ok but i definitely think diy kitchen unit and doors are better. Ikea to have some brilliant storage soloution that pull out of cupboards. They’ve had it in a few years and the door edges are starting to peel. Kitchens that are much better value than Howdens, Wickes.</p>

<p>Cant comment on the fitting because my husband fitted the whole lot himself but we had no problems with b&amp;q during the buying process or whilst paying the kitchen off over 4yrs. What we discovered is going to potentially help you to make your kitchen supplier decision. The company are trade and your fitter will get the kitchen for you.

<p>Ikeas door thicknesses are thinner than howdens. We cannot give a decision which kitchen brand is good but in my point of view, magnet kitchen is much better than howden kitchen because magnet kitchen has more advantages than howden kitchen like, it has great software which shows 360 images of the kitchen to see the client how his kitchen see after installing magnet kitchen.

<p>As with any kitchen, get a good fitter. It’s not even a howdens kitchen review (who we eventually went with). Our howden’s units are ok, for the money, but the appliances they supplied are terrible, they’ve all broken within 4 years. Kitchens that are much better value than Howdens, Wickes.</p>

<p>German kitchens are designed to sneak storage space into areas you may never even have thought of, giving us the flexibility to put together a kitchen that offers way more than the sum of its parts. They are the best priced option. Cant comment on the fitting because my husband fitted the whole lot himself but we had no problems with b&amp;q during the buying process or whilst paying the kitchen off over 4yrs.

<p>Ideally i would see a range of assembled howdens units to get a sense for their stability. We almost bought a howdens kitchen, but realised that you only buy the planning and units. Magnets have the best kitchens off the shelf probably, fitted 100�s. Second hand B&amp;Q kitchen in Currie, Edinburgh Gumtree.</p>
<h3 id="on-average-wren-kitchens-costs">On Average Wren Kitchens Costs.</h3><p>In terms of ikea kitchens, their old range was called rational or rationel, but their new range is called metod. The kitchen fitter i�m using also uses howdens, so i�ve looked on their website and am impressed, and also the rental property we are in at the moment has a basic howdens kitchen and the units are good quality compared to b&amp;q. Howdens do too but less options. We cannot give a decision which kitchen brand is good but in my point of view, magnet kitchen is much better than howden kitchen because magnet kitchen has more advantages than howden kitchen like, it has great software which shows 360 images of the kitchen to see the client how his kitchen see after installing magnet kitchen.</p>
<h3 id="our-kitchen-fitter-recommended-howdens-for-quality">Our Kitchen Fitter Recommended Howdens For Quality.</h3><p>You have to find your own fitter and they do not recommend one. Just a heads up howdens are trade only and their prices are better than b&amp;q etc for kitchen units etc. The main difference seems to be that howdens are glued and b&amp;q are flat pack. B&amp;q kitchens are the worst company that i have ever had the misfortune to come across!</p>

Howdens is the uk�s number one trade kitchen supplier providing thousands of products across kitchens, joinery, and hardware. Our first flat had a howdens kitchen and we were impressed with the beating it took over the years (!) but we didn’t let this get in the way of a getting a good deal, if it meant getting a similar quality for a better price, so we gave ikea kitchens and b&amp;q kitchens some real consideration. Also, both were far cheaper than howdens.</p>
